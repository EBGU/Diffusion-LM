# Diffusion-LM
A replication of Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation

This is a replication of [Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation](https://github.com/XiangLi1999/Diffusion-LM). 

To run this codebase, you need [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

You also need to prepare pretrained weights for BERT models is you want to save some GPU hours. I recommand following models:

Enjoy!
